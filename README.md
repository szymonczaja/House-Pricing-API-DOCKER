# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to build a production-ready Machine Learning pipeline for predicting house prices using the Ames housing dataset. Unlike typical academic projects, this solution focuses on MLOps best practices, demonstrating key skills in model deployment, custom data processing, and pipeline management.

The core objective is to move beyond simple modeling to create a robust, deployable artifact that handles real-world data challenges through custom transformers and containerization.

* **FastAPI:** Creates a high-performance, robust API service for handling prediction requests with automatic validation.
* **Docker:** Ensures consistency across environments by packaging the application, model, and dependencies into an isolated container.
* **MLflow:** Manages the lifecycle of the ML model, logging the complete pipeline to ensure consistency between training and deployment.
* **Scikit-learn / Custom Transformers:** Drives the core prediction logic with specialized transformers for data cleaning and feature creation.

## 🔬 Project Deep Dive: The Data Science Process

The complete analytical process is documented in `notebooks/house_pricing.ipynb`:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Initial deep dive to understand data distributions.
    * Identification of missing values and key correlations driving price.

2.  **Custom Feature Engineering (Critical Step):**
    * We developed custom Scikit-learn transformers to handle complex preprocessing within the pipeline.
    * **`GroupedMedianTransformer`:** Implements smart imputation based on neighborhood medians rather than global averages.
    * **`FeatureTransformer`:** Generates powerful new features (e.g., Total Square Footage, House Age) to boost model performance.

3.  **Model Prototyping:**
    * Experimentation with various algorithms to identify the optimal regressor for the dataset.

4.  **Model Registration:**
    * The final, optimized model—along with its entire preprocessing pipeline—is logged and saved using **MLflow**, making it ready for immediate serving.

5.  **Model Explainability (SHAP):**
    * Integration of **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret predictions, providing transparency and building trust by explaining *why* a specific price was predicted.

## 🛠️ How to Run the API (Using Docker)

To run the API and test the model, you only need **Docker Desktop** installed.

### 1. Build the Container Image
In the main project directory, build the image:
```bash
docker build -t house-pricing-api:latest .
